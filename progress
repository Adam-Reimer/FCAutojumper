The FC auto jumper now, at least shows up in EDMC, I have made the load file public for anyone wanting to try it out.( only use if you know what you are doing),
The FC auto jumper main project has now reached the size of 1000 lines of code and is now being optimized. Expect release in the next couple of days.
It now feature a much needed tritium placement changer that now means it can be used by any FC in the galaxy. 
This will be version 2.0 in the beta stage of develpment. After the release of the application variant. I will focus on the edmc part of the plugin.
This all for now.
