this is the readme text file that guess what? you should read!!!

	#Intro
this file is writtin in python 3 and is basically a macro to automate the boring task of jumping a fleet carrier long disctances,
The application is not yet allowed by Fdev so use at your own risk, I am NOT responsible for any bans, or account terminations of any sort performed by Fdev.
This file is completely free to use and free to distribute and modify as you please, but please do not exploit the code, this is for the comunity 
and to help out the players of elite dangerous.

	#Tutorial
for this app you will first need a .csv file ready, to do this go to the spansh FC plotter site on google, plot your route with 1000 t of tritium in the tank, 
and once the route is plotted there should be a button to download the route as a csv, download the file and put it where ever you can find it later.
now onto elite dangerous
for this to work you will need to disable 2 keybinds for keyboard and mouse, 
in the galaxy map keybinds section remove or replace the glaxy map camera yaw left and right commands, by default they should be "q" and "e",
if these keybinds are not replaced please the program will not work.
then in Elite dangerous go to your FC and dock, once there go into your right panel and highlight the FC section
then backout to the basic cockpit screen.

now launch the program, there should be 2 panels that open, one is the python terminal that shows you what is happening and what the code is doing
 the other is the user interface, if you have 2 screens you can put the python terminal on the second screen for some added enjoyment :), 
now on the UI panels please click the 'find file' button and a file explorer directory tab should pop up, find your .csv file you saved before and 
double click it.
now it should close,
well done you have ploted your route,
now whenever you are ready click on start jumping and select elite as the active application ( click on elite like if you were playing on it),
and 10 seconds after you clicked the start jumping button the code will start,
IF you have any problems along the way and the code doesnt work please take a screenshot of the terminal, (if you plan to send a report to me) and close it.
closing the terminal will stop the code.
