# Automatic Fleet Carrier jumper for Elite Dangerous

Meet BOB you're new fleet carrier guidance system

Bob will take you're fleet carrier around the galaxy without you having to be near your computer and he'll do it for free.

Bob is currently under development still and thus has some quirks that he can't really help

He is currently on version 1.5.0.



## How to use BOB

First off Bob only works in Elite dangerous horizons, Bob likes being able to not crash every 2 seconds due to badly designed Game

Secondly Bob also needs a route to follow so you need to go to https://www.spansh.co.uk/fleet-carrier and download the csv file for your trip. Next you have to place that in a file that isn't blocked for privileges, your desktop for example. Once you have started BOB he will ask you for that file path to see what his route is

Thirdly for Bob to start of correctly you have to position your selector/highlight of your internal panel over your fleet carrier management tab. Or bob will get confused, next up Bob gets confused about where tritium is stored on your fleet carrier so you need to tell him if you want him to refuel your carrier for you. This is called the Tritium placement, effectively how many times, from the bottom of you inventory do you have to press "up" for you to be highlighting Tritium

Bob is a python file and thus need to have python installed on your computer and the extensions "pyautogui" and "pydirectinput" installed using pip

Bob can get confused and fuck up with your carrier so please don't be mean to bob



## Disclaimer

Bob is SCRIPTING and BANNABLE from FDEV, If you use this script I am not responsible for anyone getting banned or losing either privileges for your carrier or even just loosing your carrier in space.

Bob only works on Windows, even though Bob is proudly developed on Linux

I have not extensively tested Bob so he might be a little old, please send me a message if you have some insight, or a bug with bob so that I can fix him.
