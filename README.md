# Autojumper
Auto Fleet Carrier Jumper for elite dangerous
  
  #short Intro
This is a project that is NOT FINISHED, the code is fully written in python 3.
The code is free to use by anyone who wishes to try it, or modify it, or any use whatsoever.
As long as the project is not used for commercial purposes and is for the good of the comunity then you may do anything you wish.
  
  #tutorial
1)To run this you will need to open the python with an IDE and import pydirectinput and pyautogui with pip.
2)Open up elite, go to your FC and make sure you are in a ship with at least 500 t of cargo space (i recomend the cutter)
3)statr up the program and a user interface will start up, dont press anything yet.
4)next open up Elite and set you rigth panel up so that it highlights the fleet carrier section without entering it)
5) Make sure that the keybinds "q" and "e" and turned off for the glaxy map navigation, (so it is used in the ui)
6) next go to spansh FC route plotter and make your route but dont change tritium in tank or anything(it restocks after everyjump)
7) download the route to a .csv file, (there is a button for it on the route plotter site) and put it on your desktop or a file where you can find it again
8) go to the new window opened by the file and click the "find file" button. then use the file explorer to find and double click your .csv file. the file explorer tab should close
9) now go into the python tab with the GUI and click the start jumping button, you will have 10 seconds before the code starts.
10) please watch your game for at least the first 2 jumps to make sure it all works
11) haev fun going across the galaxy in your sleep :)

  #warning
this code is effectivaly a macro so it uses the default keybinds for elite dangerous execpt in the galaxy map  where you have to remove the "e" and "q" keys for the navigation of the galaxy (NOT THE UI navigation keys) so when you click on "e" in the glaxy map it should take you from the info tab to the navigation tab. etc...

Since this is basically a bot I am NOT responsible for anyone banned for botting the game by FDEV, if you use this  use at your own risk.

 i will add contact info later on when i figure it out
 
 edit 2) electric boogaloo, 
 A friend of mine wants me to start coding this boi again so here I am, In the main branch I put A new file called console jumper, It;s a jumper but with no gui. seems a bit better, 
 
 Also Found someone else making basically the same thing at https://github.com/jpunwin/FleetCarrierNavComputer Check it out if you want something that looks much cleaner but missing the refuel option.
